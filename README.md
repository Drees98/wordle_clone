# wordle_clone
A project I took on to freshen up my skills in C++. 

words.txt contains a string literal that has been copied to words.h. This literal contains most, if not all, 5 letter words in the english language.

wordle_clone contains all of the functions and object required to have the wordle application run. 

Resources folder contains all of the pngs and font ttf 

Using SFML to create the GUI

All compiling done through use of makefile using mingw32

For game only download the Game folder

Future plans:
  
  1: Have the program create a file to track user games and display them

  2: Create in game tutorial page 

  3: messages pop and fade after incorrect guess
